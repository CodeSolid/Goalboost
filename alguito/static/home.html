<h1>Index.html</h1>
<p>This part of the content is defined in /static/home.html.</p>
<p>This will be the root of the site. I live in template/index.html. Add angular etc. to /static.</p>
<p>The people endpoint is here: <a href="/api/people">/api/people</a>.  This is all in transition now so it's a mess.
We have no root endpoint at this point either</p>
