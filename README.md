# Goalboost
Alguito is John and Jenniffer's retirement project.  We better figure out what it will do.  I'm still thinking time and billing, but also
project tracking.  There should be a full spec in the doc directory.

Anything here is preliminary at this point, so what we have to date is basically a virtual environment
with Eve, the Eve demo, plus support for static files.
